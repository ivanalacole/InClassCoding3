//1) Create 3 arrays, One with all String data types, one with all Numbers data types, and one with Boolean data types.  
//You will need to add sample data to each array (don't over think this). //Each array should have at least 5 elements.. 

//2) Next create a function that can take any of these arrays as a parameter 
//and add an additional String, Number, or Boolean depending on which array was passed in. 

//Hint: You will need an array method to add new items to the end of the array. 
//You will also need conditionals set up to check the item at index 0 so you know 
// what array was passed into the function.  
//You can use the typeof method to determine what type of data is in the array.  

//create arrays with string (names) number (intergers) true or false (boolean)
let name = ['Ivana', 'Jeffrey', 'Dexter', 'Devonne', 'Candice']
let birthYear = [1997, 1995, 1957, 1990, 1991]
let social = Boolean([true, false, true, false, true])


//create a function that passes through array 
function socialSec (name, birthYear) {
    if(name === birthYear){
        console.log(social)
    }else if(
        name.push('Charlie'))
    }else if(
        birth.push(2008))
    }}



//adding data to an array you will have to use .push method
